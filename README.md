# MySQL Employee Tracker

## Description
Created a command line application for managing a company's employees. In your terminal, navigate to the folder containing the app.js and the application can be invoked using the following commands:

npm i (to install all dependencies)

node .\app.js (to launch the application locally)

The following queries can be performed:

* View all employees
* View all departments
* View all roles
* Add a new employee
* Add a new department
* Add a new role
* Update an employee's role

## Technologies

* MySQL
* node.js
    * inquirer NPM
    * mysql NPM

## Challenges

In total this project took about 12 hours to build including all the time put into research and trial & error.

Difficulties included:

* nodemon and inquirer do not work well together so there was a lot of shutting down the server every time I made changes to test things out.
* making the break through for extracting particular information from queries was difficult until I could see the pattern and make sense of the errors returned by node.
